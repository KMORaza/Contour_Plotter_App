### Contour Plotter App
This is a desktop application that allows users to generate 3D contour plots based on mathematical expressions and visualize them in a separate window. Additionally, it provides functionality to save the generated plots as either PNG or can print it to PDF file.

#### Here are some calculations used:

Linespace: $x_i = a + i \cdot \frac{{b - a}}{{\text{{num}} - 1}}$

Meshgrid: $x_{ij} = X_i, \quad y_{ij} = Y_j$ where $i$ and $j$ are indices of $X$ and $Y$
