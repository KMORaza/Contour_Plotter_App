### Contour Plotter App
This is a desktop application that allows users to generate 3D contour plots based on mathematical expressions and visualize them in a separate window. Additionally, it provides functionality to save the generated plots as either PNG or can print it to PDF file. This app utilize external libraries for computations and processing of contour plots.

NOTE: There is another [repository](https://github.com/KMORaza/Contour_Generator_Script) which I had created and it contains simple Python scripts that plot contours. Please note that those scripts are different from this application whose source code I haven't uploaded here.
