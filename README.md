### Contour Plotter App
This is a desktop application that allows users to generate 3D contour plots based on mathematical expressions and visualize them in a separate window. Additionally, it provides functionality to save the generated plots as either PNG or can print it to PDF file.

Linespace: $x_i = a + i \cdot \frac{{b - a}}{{\text{{num}} - 1}}$ where $i=0,1,2,3,...,num-1$

Meshgrid: $x_{ij} = X_i, \quad y_{ij} = Y_j$ where $i$ and $j$ are indices of $X$ and $Y$

Application involves external libraries for computations and processing of contour plots.

NOTE: There is another [repository](https://github.com/KMORaza/Contour_Generator_Script) which I had created and it contains simple Python scripts that plot contours. Please note that those scripts are different from this application whose source code I haven't uploaded here.
